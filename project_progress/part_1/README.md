###  Overview
This part of the project focuses on text preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
The notebook **`Text_processing_and_EDA.ipynb`** is thoroughly documented, providing explanations for most of the implemented functions and processing steps.


###  Dataset
The code for Part 1 is configured to load the products dataset from the `data/` folder located at the root of the repository.  
Please ensure the dataset file **`fashion_products_dataset.json`** is downloaded and placed in this folder before running the notebook locally.

*(Note: the dataset is not included in the repository due to GitHub’s file size limitations.)*
