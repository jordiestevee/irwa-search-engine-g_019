### Overview
This second part focuses on building the index and implementing the query processing logic for the IR-WA Search Engine.  
The notebook **`Indexing_and_Query_Processing.ipynb`** includes detailed explanations of the main functions and decisions made during the implementation.

### Dataset
This part uses the same dataset as Part 1 (**`fashion_products_dataset.json`**) and an extra file **`validation_labels.csv`** for evaluation.  
Both files should be placed in the `data/` folder at the root of the repository before running the notebook.
